# Quasi-static imaging of earthquake cycle kinematics
`celeri` is a Python-based package designed to image earthquake cycle activity, including spatial slip deficit/fault coupling across geometrically complex fault systems at large scales. It features:

- Friendly [Jupyter notebook examples](https://github.com/brendanjmeade/celeri/blob/main/notebooks/celeri_dense.ipynb)
- GUI model building with [`celeri_ui`](https://brendanjmeade.github.io/celeri_ui/)
- Graphical comparisons of model results with [`result_manager`](https://github.com/brendanjmeade/result_manager)
- 3D visualization of model results with [`parsli`](https://github.com/brendanjmeade/parsli)
- Fast and automated block closure on the sphere
- Small memory footprint (via distance weighted eigenmodes)
- Blazingly fast elastic calculations (via [Ben Thompson's](https://github.com/tbenthompson) [cutde](https://github.com/tbenthompson/cutde))
- Easy IO with standard file types (`.csv`, `.json`, `.hdf5`, `.pkl`)


# Getting started
To set up a development conda environment, install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) and run the following command in the `celeri` folder.
```bash
pixi shell
```

Alternatively, run the following commands in the `celeri` folder.
```
conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
conda env create
conda activate celeri
pip install --no-use-pep517 -e .
```

From here, you can launch model runs with `celeri_solve`.

To run notebooks from VSCode:
1. cd to the `celeri` folder.
2. Use  `code .` to start VSCode from the command line.
3. Navigate to the notebook you'd like to run.
4. Click on the Python environment selector near the upper right-hand corner of the VSCode window.
5. Select the "default" shell.
6. Run notebook.

# Folder structure and file locations for applications
A large number of input files can be involved in a model run.  We assume that a project is arranged using the following folder structure:
```
project_name/

# Other earthquake cycle kinematics software
We think celeri is pretty great, but there are other alternatives worth considering:
- Jack Loveless' and Brendan Meade's Matlab-based [Blocks](https://github.com/jploveless/Blocks)
- Rob McCaffrey's Fortran-based [TDEFNODE](https://robmccaffrey.github.io/TDEFNODE/TDEFNODE.html)
- Richard Styron's Julia-based [Oiler](https://github.com/cossatot/Oiler)
